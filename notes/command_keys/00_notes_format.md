## `<key>`  
*(Example: `w`)*  

### Function

Provide a precise definition of what the key does, including scope and direction of motion or action.  
Mention whether it is *inclusive* (includes the endpoint) or *exclusive*.  

### Syntax

Show the typical syntactic usage or combination form (e.g., `dw`, `3w`, `yw`, `gUw`).  

### Description

Offer a formal explanation of how the key behaves. Include details such as:  
- The type of motion or operation performed.  
- Boundary rules (e.g., word definitions, line termination).  
- Interactions with counts, text objects, or other modifiers.  

### Examples

Provide practical, ascending examples — from fundamental to advanced.  
1. *Basic:* A simple example of direct usage.  
2. *Intermediate:* A combination with another motion or count.  
3. *Advanced:* A contextual or compound use case.  

### Common Pairings

List typical operator or command combinations that involve this key (e.g., `d`, `y`, `c`, `gU`, `5j`).  

### Notes

Add relevant caveats, alternate keys, or behavioral nuances.  
If the key interacts differently in certain settings (e.g., word boundaries defined by `'iskeyword'`), document that.
