### `Ctrl-y`  

**Function:**  
Scroll the window **up by one line**, moving text downward. The cursor remains on its current line.  
*Exclusive* of any selection or operator effect.  

**Syntax:**  
`Ctrl-y`, `3 Ctrl-y` (scroll multiple lines).  

**Description:**  
`Ctrl-y` moves the visible window up by one line per press, exposing preceding content. With a count, the number of lines scrolled increases proportionally. Useful for reviewing prior lines without moving the cursor.  

**Examples:**  
1. *Basic:* Press `Ctrl-y` to scroll up one line.  
2. *Intermediate:* `4 Ctrl-y` scrolls up four lines.  
3. *Advanced:* Use `Ctrl-y` in combination with `zz` to recenter cursor after review.  

**Common Pairings:**  
Often paired with `Ctrl-e` for smooth vertical review.  

**Notes:**  
Reaching the top of the buffer halts scrolling.
