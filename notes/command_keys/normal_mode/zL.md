### `zL`  

**Function:**  
Scroll the window **right by half a screen width**, cursor remains fixed.  

**Syntax:**  
`zL`, `2 zL`.  

**Description:**  
Shifts viewport right by half the visible width. Useful for reviewing hidden text horizontally in wide lines.  

**Examples:**  
1. *Basic:* `zL` scrolls half-screen right.  
2. *Intermediate:* `2 zL` scrolls a full screen right.  
3. *Advanced:* Combine with `zh`/`zl` for fine-tuned viewport navigation.  

**Common Pairings:**  
`zH` for leftward half-screen scrolling.  

**Notes:**
